====================================
Notes for register_activation_hook()
====================================



* register_activation_hook() must be called from within the main plugin file.



* register_activation_hook() must not be registered from within another hook (e.g., "plugins_loaded" or "init"), because such hooks are called before the plugin is activated.



* If the activation callback function is located in any file other than the main plugin file, you can include the file before registering with the activation hook, for example:

	include_once dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/includes/activation.php';
	register_activation_hook( __FILE__, 'myplugin_activation_function' );



* If building a plugin for WP Multisite, it is better to use the "admin_init" hook. More info:

* Never echo/print anything for any of these three hooks:

	register_activation_hook()
	register_deactivation_hook()
	register_uninstall_hook()
